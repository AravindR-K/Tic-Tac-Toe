# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe — A Simple JavaScript Project

This is a basic Tic-Tac-Toe game I made to learn how JavaScript works. It was a small personal project to get hands-on with coding, practice logic building, and understand how things connect on the front end.

## 💡 Why I Built This
I wanted to try out JavaScript in a practical way, so I picked something simple and familiar—a game that could be made without using any external libraries or frameworks.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Basic DOM manipulation
- Handling user input with event listeners
- Managing game state (turns, win/draw conditions)
- Styling with CSS and connecting it all with HTML
