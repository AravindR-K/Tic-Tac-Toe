# Tic-Tac-Toe
"Built a Tic-Tac-Toe game from scratch—just to learn how JavaScript works!" Sometimes, the best way to learn is by creating something fun. It was about diving into code, understanding the logic behind interactivity, and seeing how JavaScript brings ideas to life. A simple game, yes—but learnt a lot :)
